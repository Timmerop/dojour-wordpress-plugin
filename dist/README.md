# Dojour Plugin

This plugin allows businesses to publish their events from Dojour to their wordpress site automatically!

## How does it work?

If you have a business account on Dojour, go to your [Admin Tools](https://dojour.us/admin-tools/profile) and click on the connect button next to the "Connect WordPress" item, a window will show you the steps you need to follow.

After connecting your WordPress site successfully, any event you publish will also create a post on your site.

## Post Frequency
You can select between two different frequencies:

### One Post Per Event
Only one post will be created per event.

### One Post Per Showing
One post will be created for every showing (date/time combination) your event has

## Requirements
This plugin requires the [Application Passwords Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/application-passwords/) to be installed as well in order to secure the creation of posts.
